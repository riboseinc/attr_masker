Mask ActiveRecord/Mongoid data with ease!

== Introduction

This gem is intended to mask sensitive data so that production database dumps
can be used in staging or test environments.

* Works with Rails 4.2+ and modern Rubies
* Supports ActiveRecord and Mongoid models


== Usage instructions

=== Installation

Add `attr_masker` to your `Gemfile`:

[source,ruby]
----
gem "attr_masker"
# or the HEAD version of the gem
# gem "attr_masker", github: "riboseinc/attr_masker"
----


Then install the gem:

[source,sh]
----
bundle install
----

=== Basic usage

In your models, define attributes which should be masked:

[source,ruby]
----
class User
  attr_masker :email, :first_name, :last_name
end
----

Then, when you want to mask the data, run the `db:mask` Rake task in some
Rails environment other than production, for example:

[source,sh]
----
bundle exec rake db:mask RAILS_ENV=staging
----

WARNING: Data are destructively overwritten.  Run `rake db:mask` with care!

=== Masking records selectively

You can use `:if` and `:unless` options to prevent some records from being
altered.

[source,ruby]
----
# evaluates given proc for each record, and the record is passed as a proc's
# argument
attr_masker :email :unless => ->(record) { ! record.tester_user? }

# calls #tester_user? method on each record
attr_masker :first_name, :if => :tester_user?
----

The ActiveRecord's `::default_scope` method has no effect on masking.  All
table records are updated, provided that `:if` and `:unless` filters allow that.
For example, if you're soft-deleting your data (with a gem like
https://github.com/rubysherpas/paranoia[Paranoia]), records marked as deleted
will be masked as well.

=== Built-in maskers

Attr Masker comes with several built-in maskers.

==== `AttrMasker::Maskers::Simple`

Simply replaces any value with the `"(redacted)"`.  Only useful for columns
containing textual data.

This is a default masker.  It is used when `:masker` option is unspecified.

[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
attr_masker :first_name
attr_masker :last_name, :masker => AttrMasker::Maskers::Simple.new
----

Would set both `first_name` and `last_name` attributes to `"(redacted)"`.
====

==== `AttrMasker::Maskers::Replacing`

Replaces characters with some masker string (single asterisk by default).
Can be initialized with options.

[options="header"]
|===
|Name|Default|Description

|`replacement`|`"*"`|Replacement string, can be empty.
|`alphanum_only`|`false`|When true, only alphanumeric characters are replaced.
|===

[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
rm = AttrMasker::Maskers::Replacing.new(character: "X", alphanum_only: true)
attr_masker :phone, :masker => rm
----

Would mask `"123-456-7890"` as `"XXX-XXX-XXXX"`.
====

=== Using custom maskers

Apart from built-in maskers, any object which responds to `#call` can be used,
e.g. some lambda or `Method` instance.  For instance, you may want to produce
unique values basing on other attributes, to mask selectively, or to use
tool like https://github.com/skalee/well_read_faker[Well Read Faker] to
generate random replacement values:

[source,ruby]
----
require "well_read_faker"

attr_masker :email, masker: ->(model:, **) { "user#{model.id}@example.com" }
attr_masker :phone, masker: ->(value:, **) { "******" + value[-3..-1] }
attr_masker :bio, masker: ->(**) { WellReadFaker.paragraph }
----

Masker is called with following keyword arguments:

`value`:: Original value of the field which is about to be masked

`model`:: Model instance

`attribute_name`:: Name of the attribute which is about to be masked

`masking_options`:: Hash of options which were passed in `#attr_masker` call

This list is likely to be extended in future versions, and that will not be
considered a breaking change, therefore it is strongly recommended to always
use a splat (`**`) at end of argument list of masker's `#call` method.

=== Configuration file

It is also possible to contain all the maskers configuration in one file.
Just place it in `config/attr_masker.rb`, and it will be loaded from a Rake
task after the application is fully loaded.  That means you can re-open classes
and add masker definitions there, for example:

[source,ruby]
----
# config/attr_masker.rb

class User
  attr_masker :first_name, :last_name
end

class Email
  attr_masker :address, ->(model:, **) { "mail#{model.id}@example.com" }
end
----

== Roadmap & TODOs

- documentation
- spec tests
- Make the `Rails.env` (in which `db:mask` could be run) configurable
** maybe by passing `ENV` vars
- more masking options!
** default scrambling algorithms?
** structured text preserving algorithms
*** _e.g._, keeping an HTML snippet valid HTML, but with masked inner text
** structured *Object* preserving algorithms
*** _i.e._ generalization of the above HTML scenario
- I18n of the default `"(redacted)"` phrase
- ...
